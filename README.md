#Introduction

This is a project to study the investment opurtunity in cryptocurrency.
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.
Holding Bitcoin means to have a share in this venture. If Bitcoin ever replaces monetary reserves of central banks or becomes the dominant currency for international trades – just to name two examples — the value of one Bitcoin will be far beyond 10,000 Dollar. Buying and keeping cryptocurrencies is a bet on the success of this silent revolution of money. It's like a security of a large ecosystem.
This study was done for personel purpose, so its not a full fledged study about investment opurtunities. Anyone is free to reuse the codes for their personel needs.

##Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
Twitter is an online social network with over 330 million active monthly users as of February 2018. Twitter employs a message size restriction of 280 characters or less which forces the users to stay focused on the message they wish to disseminate. This very characteristic makes messages on twitter very good candidates for the Machine Learning (ML) task of sentiment analysis. Using sentiment analysis on tweets we will get a general view about the minds of people. More the people having a positive outlook towards cryptocurrency means people will invest more and it will not crash soon. This is especially usefull during bubble phases of the coin which happened in end of 2017. 
On side note -> When one sees that the general sentiment of people are more negative thats when one should take out one investment.
